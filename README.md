# wordanalyser

This is my initial code for a group assignment. The task was to create a ui for grammatical analysis tool that show various grammatical statistics tables based on user input. This code mocks the server response and presents the user with an initial analysis. This vanilla js was later implemented in React and is currently available at https://elle.tlu.ee/tools/wordanalyser
